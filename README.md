## How to run this bot?

- First, install `python3`, latest version preferred.
- Second, create a virtual environment so your global `python3` won't be badly affected and activate it (most IDEs
  automatically activate it for you)

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Third, install required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements_core.txt
```

- After that, create a config file naming `config.py`
  and [fill it](https://github.com/Lilia-Workshop/nameless/wiki/config.py).
  Also [setup your database](https://github.com/Lilia-Workshop/nameless/wiki/Setup-database-(PostgreSQL)) (PostgreSQL
  for example, YMMV. We also support MongoDB/MongoDB Atlas).

- Lastly, run the `main.py` file:

```shell
python3 main.py
```
