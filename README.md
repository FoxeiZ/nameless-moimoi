----------------------------------------

## How to run this bot?

- First, install `python3` or `pypy`, latest version preferred.
- Second, create a virtual environment so your global "python" won't be badly affected and activate it (most IDEs
  automatically activate it for you)

```shell
python3/pypy -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

- Third, install required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements_core.txt
```

- After that, edit `config.example.py` then rename to `config.py`.

- Lastly, run the `main.py` file:

```shell
python main.py
```
